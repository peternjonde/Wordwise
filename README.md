# :bulb: About WordWise


WordWise is the ultimate spell checker!

Proper spelling has become a hygiene standard in both professional and non-professional areas of life. With a plethora of spell-checking software provided to us every domain of our digital lives, misspelled words within documents have become (or are expected to have become) a thing of the past. In this project, we will created a spell-checking software similar to those widely available to the public as a way of learning and demonstrating our ability to collaborate on a piece of software as a small development team. 

This software consists of a desktop application capable of spell-checking individual text documents. All words in the document will be checked and cross-referenced with a dictionary, picking out words that the software believes to be misspelled. Upon the encounter of one of these unrecognized words, the user will be offered several alternatives, each being a possible correction to the error. In addition, the user will also be offered the option to manually correct the word in question if the correct solution isn’t provided automatically. Once the application is finished processing the document, the result will be a revised version with correct spelling from start to finish.




# :open_file_folder: Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Other files which exist in the workspace are the 'words_alpha.txt' file, which contains the system dictionary, and the 'user_dict.txt' file, which contains the User Dictionary.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

To build the project, run the **Main.java** class under the `src` folder.
